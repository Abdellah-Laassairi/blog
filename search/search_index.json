I'm Abdellah Laassairi , a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer based in \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 France . You can talk to my AI Dopplganger below if you want to know more about me. If he doesn't answer, then he's probably taking a nap. In case Abdellah v0.0.1 is down (as the lil lazy AI he is), you can take a look at the following sections to learn more about me. I'm currently working at Oris Materials Intelligence , where we are on a mission to revolutionize infrastructure sustainability. By harnessing the power of AI and data analytics , we enable industries to make smarter material choices that significantly reduce their CO\u2082 emissions \u2014 building a better, greener future for all. My expertise lies in harnessing the power of Machine Learning , Deep Learning , and MLOps to design systems that are as impactful as they are scalable. With a special interest in AGI , I'm fascinated by the transformative potential AI holds in unlocking new future for our species and planet. My Toolkit Here's a glimpse at the technologies and tools I use to make ideas come alive: Programming Languages : Python,C++, R Frameworks & Libraries : PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Jax, Hugging Face DevOps & MLOps : Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, Airflow Cloud Platforms : AWS Other Tools : Git, Jupyter What I'm Up To Here's what I'm currently focused on: Pioneering ML Models : Developing sophisticated models and robust pipelines for real-world impact. Exploring Large Language Models : Delving into the nuances of LLMs and their applications in AI-powered solutions. Building Data Infrastructure : Crafting scalable ecosystems for handling complex and dynamic data. Advancing Sustainability : Collaborating with Oris Materials Intelligence to reduce CO\u2082 emissions through AI-driven insights. Personal Pursuits : Channeling creativity through music and poetry when I'm off the clock. Fun Fact Did you know? I believe that coding is just like music \u2014 structured, creative, and endlessly rewarding. Let's Stay Connected! $ echo \"Let's connect & build something amazing together!\" Leaving a hello world for good luck : import numpy as np # this import is also part of the ritual def hello_world (): print( \"Hello, World!\" ) I'm always eager to collaborate, share ideas, and learn from others in the field.

Don't get me wrong, Jira is essential . It's the backbone of project management. But here's the thing: while Jira is essential for organization , it can feel like it was specifically designed to slow down development . You're in your happy place with your favorite IDE open, knee-deep in Python or whatever programming language / stack you're using and then BAM! You forgot to create a Jira ticket for this new feature / task that you're already half way through. Now you're clicking through endless menus, copying and pasting issue keys, manually updating your issue description and scope, finding the right template, project to attach\u2026 The Programmer's dilemma As programmers, software engineers, and data scientists, our brains are wired for efficiency, for automation, for making computers do the tedious stuff so we can focus on the interesting stuff. Jira, in its default, manual-task-loving state, often feels like the antithesis of everything we stand for. Our typical Jira-induced woes include: Jira Ticket Creation Pain: Your model completes a 12-hour training run. Celebration! Now comes the 15-minute Jira update ritual. Right click. Copy. Switch tabs. Paste. Repeat until carpal tunnel sets in. The Context Switch Tax: Every manual Jira interaction costs context switch action. Disturbing your flow state and productivity. Research shows that developers lose up to 20% of productivity when juggling two tasks due to the mental effort of reorienting between contexts. Jira Data Extraction - The CSV Black Hole: \"Oh, you want to analyze Jira data? Sure, here's a CSV with 73 columns, 68 of which are completely irrelevant, and the 5 you actually need are buried somewhere in a JSON blob within a text field. Enjoy!\" \ud83d\ude08 Time for some automation with jiragen \u2728 jiragen is your friendly AI sidekick who'd love to write your own Jira tickets for you. It's designed to make your life easier by: Automating repetitive Jira tasks: Think of it as your personal Jira AI assistant. Need to write a bunch of tickets based on your current codebase / documentation or already existing tickets? jiragen can handle it. Want to automatically upload and add components to that ticket? jiragen is on it. Alright, Spill the Beans! How Do I Wield This jiragen Magic? \ud83e\udd14 Good question! Getting started with jiragen is simpler than explaining the nuances of gradient boosting to your non-technical relatives at Thanksgiving dinner. (Seriously, stick to \"I work with computers\" \u2013 trust me on this one.) Installation: The First Step to Jira Freedom If you're reading this, you probably breathe Python. So, installation will be a breeze: pip install jiragen Boom! You've just taken the first step towards Jira liberation. (Okay, maybe 5% of the way, but every journey starts with a single pip install , right?) Configuration: Making Jiragen Your Own \ud83c\udf9b\ufe0f Jiragen offers flexible configuration options through multiple channels: Command-line arguments : For quick, one-off customizations Configuration file ( ~/.jiragen/config.ini ): For persistent settings Environment variables : For sensitive data and CI/CD pipelines Setting Up Your Environment First, you'll need to configure your JIRA credentials and preferred LLM settings either by running jiragen init or by editing the ~/.jiragen/config.ini file, or even by setting the environment variables. # Using environment variables export JIRA_API_TOKEN = \"your-api-token\" export JIRA_EMAIL = \"your-email@company.com\" export JIRA_URL = \"https://your-company.atlassian.net\" # For OpenAI integration (optional) export OPENAI_API_KEY = \"your-openai-key\" If you're using local models through Ollama (recommended for privacy), you can configure the LLM settings in your config file, or using the --model flag in the CLI. CLI Usage: Your Swiss Army Knife for Jira \ud83d\udd27 Let's explore some powerful CLI commands that will make your life easier: 1. Codebase Management # Initialize jiragen in your project jiragen init # Index your entire codebase (respects .gitignore) jiragen add . # Add specific files or directories jiragen add important.py README.md # Remove files from index jiragen rm deprecated/ 2. Issue Generation # Basic issue generation jiragen generate \"Implement user authentication flow\" # Generate with custom template jiragen generate \"Add rate limiting to API\" \\ --template templates/feature.md \\ --model ollama/phi4 # Generate and directly upload to JIRA jiragen generate \"Fix memory leak in data processing\" --upload --yes # Interactive mode with editor jiragen generate \"OAuth2 integration\" --editor 3. Status and Management # View indexed files jiragen status jiragen status --compact # Sync with JIRA jiragen fetch --types epics tickets Pro Tips \ud83d\udca1 Template Organization : Keep your templates organized in ~/.jiragen/templates/ for easy access: ~/.jiragen/templates/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 feature.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 bug.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 epic.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 subtask.md What now?
