# <i class="fa-solid fa-hand-sparkles icon"></i> About Me

Hey there! I'm **Abdellah Laassairi**, a
**Data Scientist** and **Machine Learning Engineer** based in
**🇫🇷 France**. You can talk to my AI Dopplganger below if you want to know more about me.
If he doesn't answer, then he's probably taking a nap.

I'm currently working at **Oris Materials Intelligence**, where we are on a mission to revolutionize infrastructure sustainability. By harnessing the power of **AI and data analytics**, we enable industries to make smarter material choices that significantly reduce their **CO₂ emissions** — building a better, greener future for all.

My expertise lies in harnessing the power of **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **MLOps** to design systems that are as impactful as they are scalable. With a special interest in **AGI**, I'm fascinated by the transformative potential AI holds in unlocking new future for our species and planet.

```bash
$ echo "Let's connect & build something amazing together!"
```
Leaving a hello world for good luck :

```python
import numpy as np  # this import is also part of the ritual


def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
